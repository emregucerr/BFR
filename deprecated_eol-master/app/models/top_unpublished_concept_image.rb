# This class shouldn't be used.  :)  It's really just here so that fixtures load into the right database.  Meaning,
# this *class* doesn't perform any special function.  The top_iages table, however, is used for denormalized searches
# on (normal, vetted, visible, published) images. That table is referenced by DataObject#cached_images_for_taxon().
# That table is *built* using PHP, so you will not see any other ref to it.
