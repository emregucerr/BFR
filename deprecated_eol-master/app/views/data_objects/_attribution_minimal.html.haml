-# and link it to the previous version with a GUID... so the "raw" ID will always always be the same.  This is also

-# routines.  ...So we're going to try this out for articles for a while... it should speed up some of the common
-# text-heavy details tabs and overviews.  That said, there is one caveat:
-# if the dato gets more associations, it will not show them.  TODO - attempt to set up an observer to handle those.
- # TODO: Refactor attribution s to make better use of model and/or helper methods as they have all gone a little wild.
