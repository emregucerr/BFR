          A data object can have many associations. Each association is a hieararchy entry, and the data object will appear on that entry's page
          %b
            and all of that page's ancestors
          \. Below are each of those associations (taxon concepts), followed by a list of their ancestors (each line has a link to the page where it will appear, then another link to the source entry that caused the associationâ€”helping you find the hierarchy entry responsible for the ancestor). These are then followed by a breakdown of each of the hierarchy entries associated with the page and some information about it.
          Note that there is
          %i
            usually
          only one association. ...Not many data objects have multiple associations.
