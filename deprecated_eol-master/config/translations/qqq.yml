          This is a message given in the context of an error. So, for example, this might imply that the value of "Age" is incorrect, because it must be over 18. So the message is presented to the right of the "Age" field and, in red, says "must be greater than 18".

          This means that the verb "must" should always be translated as singular, since it refers to "age". The PLURAL template could be useful in this message if the translation includes the word (year(s)), for example, "(the age) must be greater than 18 year/years".

                it musn''t already be published and there must not be a more recent

        inaccessible: This is VERY LOW PRIORITY for translation, please move on; it
          will only be seen by developers but its inclusion in translations is required
          for specs to pass.

      For clarity, we call the relationship a 'field', where the user can select such
      options as 'Preys On' or 'Body Mass' and the like, and later specify the value
      for that relationship/field. This string is used in the textarea of the form
      where the select that relationship. (But, again, we call it a 'field' on the

    of the 'type' argument.  But this is a RARE error (it should really never show

  classifications_split_column_header: Column header on table; the cells below this

    a classification) for either a split (separated into a new page) or move (merge
    the data from these classifications onto an existing page).
  classifications_summary_header_with_count: Please note that there is an exceptional
    value for zero, here, which does not display the actual count, but instead a brief
    message explaining that the page the user is viewing is not easily availble on
    EOL (the user was likely directed here with a specific link) and that there are
    no *browsable* classifications for this page.  The notion here is that there are
    some classifications (trees of life) that are stored in EOL's databases, but the
    user cannot view them (browse them) by default. Note this is used as a header,
    so punctuation is not (generally) appropriate.

    (CMS) editor tool

  collection_items_count: |-
    {{Identical|Empty}}
    {{Identical|Item}}
  collection_copy_complete_with_count: A notification message informing the user how
    many collection items were copied. "from" is the name of the source collection,
    "to" is the name of the target collection(s) (this can be a list of several collections),
    and when the number is more than one, there should be an indication that the count
    is a TOTAL number of items moved. For exampe, if a user copies 2 items from a
    collection to two collections, the count will be 4 (2 for each target collection).
  collection_move_complete_with_count: A notification message informing the user how
    many collection items were moved. "from" is the name of the source collection,
    "to" is the name of the target collection(s) (this can be a list of several collections),
    and when the number is more than one, there should be an indication that the count

    or 'Comments on Procyon Lotor' or 'Comments on Jeremy Rice'.  Thus, this string
    is prepended to the title of the page where the comments were originally left,
    and these titles are supplied by content partners, so we CANNOT know the number,
    gender, or other information about the string.
  common_name_avg: these are table column headings, and the 'avg' is meant to represent

    will be used as a link, which, when clicked, will take them to a page where they
    can add that translation (we call it a translation because it is language-specific;
    why it is not in TWN is because it requires domain expertise to properly translate).
  known_uri_name_and_uri: A known URI will have a name (human-readable), and a (pretty
    ugly, often long) URI, and we want to show both; the latter in parenthesis (or
    whatever subordinate punctuation is suitable in your language).
  known_uri_updated: Used as success message.
  known_uri_label_inverse: Used in an administrator's interface to define new URIs
    associated with triplestore data. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore
    ... This term describes a relationship between two nodes in which the predicate
    is the inverse of the object. This phrase will NOT be used in sentence form, it's
    a selectable 'type' of relationship between predicate and object.
  known_uri_label_allowed_val: Used in an administrator's interface to define new
    URIs associated with triplestore data. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore
    ... This term describes a relationship between two nodes in which the predicate
    allows a value of the type described by the object. This phrase will NOT be used
    in sentence form, it's a selectable 'type' of relationship between predicate and
    object.
  known_uri_label_allowed_unit: Used in an administrator's interface to define new
    URIs associated with triplestore data. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore
    ... This term describes a relationship between two nodes in which the predicate
    allows a unit type specified by the object. This phrase will NOT be used in sentence
    form, it's a selectable 'type' of relationship between predicate and object.
  known_uri_label_unit: Used in an administrator's interface to define new URIs associated
    with triplestore data. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore ... This term
    describes a relationship between two nodes in which the predicate has a default
    unit type as specified by the object. This phrase will NOT be used in sentence
    form, it's a selectable 'type' of relationship between predicate and object.
  known_uri_label_equivalent: Used in an administrator's interface to define new URIs
    associated with triplestore data. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore
    ... This term describes a relationship between two nodes in which the predicate
    is equivalent to the object. This phrase will NOT be used in sentence form, it's
    a selectable 'type' of relationship between predicate and object.
  known_uri_label_indirectly_equivalent: Used in an administrator's interface to define
    new URIs associated with triplestore data. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore
    ... This term describes a relationship between two nodes in which the predicate
    is indirectly equivalent to the object. There is a relationship 'is equivalent
    to', which can connect two URIs. But if A is equivalent to B and B is equivalent
    to C, A is indirectly equivalent to C. This phrase will NOT be used in sentence
    form, it's a selectable 'type' of relationship between predicate and object.

    have spaces.
  only_multi_search_suggestions: This is informational text on a form viewable only

    the sorting of search suggestions. For example, if the admin wanted to create
    several search suggestions for 'sliverfish', they could set Thysanura with a value
    of 1 so it appears first, then Raiamas senegalensis with a value of 2 and Pleuragramma
    antarcticum with a value of 3, so it appears last.

  or_email_education: The user was presented with a button (see add_education_resources_to_page_link_button)

    In that popup is a link which allows the user to see the full glossary of URIs
    in EOL's data; see_in_data_glossary is the text that appears as that link. It
    is meant to capture the ability to see this definition in the context of all other

    but they don't *have* to.

  view_in_classification: This is a link, used on the "Names" tab of a species page
    on EOL, which allows the user to see the species in the context of a specific
    classification. For example, Catlogue of Life gives us one "tree of life," different
    from other partner's trees, and you could use this link to view a page in its
    context without any "interference" from the other classifications.

  watch_list_newsfeed: This is used as the label on a tab.  A watchlist is a collection
