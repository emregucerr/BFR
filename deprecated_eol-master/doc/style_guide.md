Style Guide for EOL
===================

For the most part, you should be following [The Ruby Style Guide] [1] and [The
Rails Style Guide] [2].

Exemplar files
--------------

There are several exemplar files in the code marked with EXEMPLAR keyword at
the beginning. They aim to give idea how do we want to implement best practices
and and follow code styles.

Controller
----------
You should:
* Follow this pattern (of thin controller methods) as closely as possible.
  Public methods should follow REST/CRUD, everything else should be kept
  private.
* Move as much logic as you can to the models.
* If the action itself needs access control, that access control should be
  handled here in the controller. (Note that much access control is handled at
  the model layer, by contrast.)

Feature Spec (for testing the full stack)
-----------------------------------------

You should:

* Avoid using mocks and stubs (except WebMock).
* Test all the basic CRUD workflows.
* DEFINITELY test a "render" as part of the Read.
* Test any resource-specific edge-cases (though this is lower priority).
* MINIMIZE your feature specs! These are expensive.
* NOTE any exceptions.

NOTE that we are not testing for simple "is here" or "is not here", as those
types of tests belong in a view spec.

NOTE There is no spec for destroying or deleting a CP, because we don't
allow it.
  
This is as close as we get to a "read" spec, here, because specifics
belong in a view spec, but having a feature spec ensure that the full
stack renders is actually useful.

Abbreviations
-------------

The following abbreviations are standard in the EOL environment and are thus
"okay" to be used despite their short length (whereas abbreviations are
generally frowned upon).

**cp** Content Partner
**dato** Data Object
**he** Hierarchy Entry
**tc** Taxon Concept

Ruby Style
----------

* Prefer #first to #[0].
* Prefer #last to #[-1].

RubyOnRails Style
-----------------

* Prefer #blank? to #nil?, #empty?, or !="" ...when it makes sense.
* Do *not* prefer human-readable URLs. One of the purposes of EOL is to
  normalize human-readable data; we *must* rely on stable ID URLs as those
  strings change over time. *NOTE that this is an exception to the Ruby Style
  Guide.*

RSpec Style
-----------

Follow the guidelines in [Better Specs] [3] first. The following are our
additions.

* Capitalize the word "NOT" or "NO" when used in spec descriptions.

    it "is NOT creatable" do
      expect(subject.can_be_created_by?(a_user)).to be false
    end
